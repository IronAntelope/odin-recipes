                <li>1 cup brown rice</li>
                <li>Firm tofu, diced</li>
                <li>1/2 spanish onion, jullienne</li>
                <li>1 small to medium mushroom, thinly sliced</li>
                <li>1/4 Red capsicum, diced</li>
                <li>1/2 cup of corn</li>
                <li>1/2 lime</li>
                <li>Pinch of salt</li>
                <li>1/2 avocado, sliced into wedges</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        
        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <p>
            <ol>
                <li>Add one cup of brown rice to a saucepan with three cups of water. 
                    Heat on medium-high flame. It will start to boil over after about 15 mins 
                    (not to worry, you can clean later).
                </li>
                <li>While the rice is cooking, there is about 25 minutets spare to cut up all 
                    the veges.
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p>The order in which you cook the veges isn't that important, however, the 
                    follow instructions are a good guide.</p>
            <ol>
                <li value="3">With about 10 minutes left on the rice, heat a non-stick pan 
                    on medium-high flame. First cook the tofu for 5 minutes or until browned 
                    (you can take the tofu out and add it back in later or leave it in).
                </li>
                <li>Add the sliced mushroom, and stir occasionally.
                </li>
                <li>Once mushrooms are soft, add the onion, corn and capsicum. Stir constantly and  
                    season generously with pepper. You can add a bit of water to get a sizzle and
                    really cook the pepper through.
                </li>
                <li>With rice and veges both cooked now, serve the rice first and top with the 
                    veges and avocado wedges. Garnish with squeezed lime juice and enjoy!
                </li>
            </ol>
